# The default Preonic layout - largely based on the Planck's
# Some basic changes that I made to make the keyboard more useable. 
# First I made the enter a dual key with shift.  Hold is shif and tap is enter.
# Second I added a ten key on the dvorak layer - ewww dvorak.
# The ten key is mostly for gaming and excell.
